" The term space complexity generally refers to the memory space that a code uses while being executed. Again space complexity is also dependent on the machine and so we are going to represent the space complexity using the Big O notation instead of using the standard units of memory like MB, GB, etc. "

Space complexity= Auxilary Space + Input space

Auxilary space:-The space that you take to solve the problem.
Input space:= The space that you take to store the input.

Example:- we take a variable A and B 
and variable C=A+B
Here A and B are the Input space and C is the Auxilary space.
